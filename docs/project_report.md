# Urban Mobility Explorer - Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project implements a comprehensive spatiotemporal mobility analysis system that processes urban transportation data to uncover patterns in how people move throughout the city. By leveraging trip data with spatial and temporal dimensions, the API provides actionable insights for urban planners, transportation services, and researchers.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Urban mobility patterns are complex and dynamic, making it challenging for city planners and transportation services to optimize infrastructure and services. Traditional analysis methods often fail to capture the intricate relationships between spatial locations and temporal patterns.

### 1.2 Solution Approach
We developed a RESTful API that processes trip data to:
- Identify mobility hotspots and congestion zones
- Analyze temporal patterns across hours, days, and seasons
- Map origin-destination flows between key locations
- Provide interactive visualizations and data exports

### 1.3 Key Objectives
âœ… **Spatial Analysis**: Identify where movement happens through clustering and heatmaps  
âœ… **Temporal Analysis**: Understand when movement occurs through time-series analysis  
âœ… **Spatiotemporal Fusion**: Track how mobility patterns evolve over time and space  
âœ… **Actionable Insights**: Provide data-driven recommendations for urban planning  

## 2. Methodology & Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Data Foundation
The analysis leverages comprehensive trip data, including:
- **Geospatial Coordinates**: Pickup/dropoff latitude and longitude
- **Temporal Features**: Trip timestamps and duration
- **Contextual Data**: Passenger count, vendor information

### 2.2 Analytical Framework

#### Spatial Analysis Layer
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups nearby coordinates into mobility hotspots
- **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Identifies density-based clusters for irregular patterns
- **Heatmap Generation**: Visualizes trip concentration across geographic areas
- **Flow Analysis**: Maps major movement corridors between zones

#### Temporal Analysis Layer  
- **Time-Series Decomposition**: Breaks down patterns by hour, day, week, month
- **Peak Detection**: Identifies rush hours and seasonal variations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Discovers weekday vs. weekend behaviors

#### Integration Layer
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Animated heatmaps showing pattern evolution
- **Interactive Filtering**: Real-time data exploration by time and location
- **Statistical Summaries**: Key metrics and performance indicators
